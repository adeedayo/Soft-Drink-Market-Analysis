 # Project Background
Soft drinks are sold through thousands of small retail outlets across Alimosho, Lagos, ranging from shops and kiosks to supermarkets and restaurants. With many brands competing for visibility and shelf space, distributors and retailers need clear insight into which products are available, how well they are stocked, and how packaging and display choices affect consumer buying decisions. I analyzed field survey data collected across retail outlets to understand product availability, packaging trends, display methods, and stock condition, with the goal of uncovering opportunities for better distribution and merchandising.

# Data Structure & Initial Checks
The original dataset included 1,500 survey records and 38 columns, covering outlet details, product names, packaging types, and stock conditions. After unpivoting product, display types and packaging indicators to create a usable analysis structure, the dataset expanded to about 450,000 rows, because each product and package combination was separated into its own observation.

Prior to analysis, a series of data quality checks were also conducted using Power Query Editor to ensure accuracy and reliability of insights. 

Key steps included:

· Handling missing values in product display fields and package types to ensure consistency.

· Checking for duplicate records.

# Executive Summary
Coca-Cola, Pepsi and Fanta were the most widely available soft drink products across surveyed outlets in Alimosho, showing strong market presence and visibility. PET bottles were the most common packaging format used by nearly every major product, far ahead of cans and glass bottles. Stock levels were mixed, only a portion of products were well stocked, while many outlets recorded partially stocked, suggesting supply challenges. Shops and kiosks dominated distribution, and the highest outlet concentration appeared along major commercial routes like Akowonjo and Ijegun. In contrast, areas close to Murtala Muhammad Airport showed fewer outlets, signaling possible expansion opportunities.

# Insights Deep-Dive

Coca-Cola led strongly in product availability, appearing in more outlets than any other brand. Pepsi followed closely behind, while other brands like Mountain Dew and Fayrouz showed noticeably lower presence. PET bottles stood out as the most used packaging format across almost every product, suggesting both retailer preference and strong consumer demand for PET.

Stock levels revealed performance gaps. Although some top brands were consistently well stocked, many products showed large portions of partial stock or almost-empty status, which may mean restocking delays or fast turnover not matched by supply. Display analysis showed heavy reliance on display stands, shelf and carton displays inside stores, while refrigerator and cooler displays were used less often, limiting impulse cold-drink purchases.

Mapping outlet locations showed dense clusters around key commercial roads where customer traffic is high, meaning strong competition. Meanwhile, fewer outlets appeared across the Murtala Muhammad Airport axis and parts of the southwest rural edge, showing room for market growth.

# Recommendations
### Improve Stock Consistency
Frequent low-stock and almost-empty levels suggest that distribution schedules may not be aligned with demand.

Action: Work with distributors to increase delivery frequency for high-demand products, especially in busy corridors like Akowonjo, Ijaiye and Ijegun.
Action: Create a simple reorder alert plan for outlets that frequently show low stock.
 
### Expand Cooler and Premium Display Placement
Most products are displayed on display stand, shelves or cartons, limiting impulse buying opportunities.

Action: Provide cooler-placement support to shop owners in high-traffic outlets and run joint visibility promotions.
Action: Encourage premium shelf positions for leading products in shops and supermarkets.

### Target Expansion in Low-Competition Areas
Outlet concentration is high in the eastern and northern commercial zone, but weaker in areas close Murtala Muhammad Airport and the rural southwest.

Action: Focus distribution expansion and brand awareness in underserved areas to grow coverage at lower competitive pressure.

### Improve Packaging Mix Strategy
PET bottles dominate, but cans and glass offer value for niche segments like restaurants and events.

Action: Promote can formats specifically to restaurants and bars and run bundle discounts for households through retail shops.

# Expected Outcomes

- Higher in-store availability and fewer low-stock periods, improving customer purchase chances

- Increased impulse-buy sales from better cooler and premium display usage

- Wider product coverage in underserved parts of Alimosho and stronger competitive reach

- Improved packaging mix performance from targeted channel strategies
