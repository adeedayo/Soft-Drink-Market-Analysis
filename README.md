# Project Background
Soft drinks are sold through thousands of small retail outlets across Alimosho, Lagos, ranging from shops and kiosks to supermarkets and restaurants. With many brands competing for visibility and shelf space, distributors and retailers need clear insight into which products are available, how well they are stocked, and how packaging and display choices affect consumer buying decisions. I analyzed field survey data collected across retail outlets to understand product availability, packaging trends, display methods, and stock condition, with the goal of uncovering opportunities for better distribution and merchandising.

Data Structure & Initial Checks

The original dataset included 1,500 survey records and 38 columns, covering outlet details, product names, packaging types, and stock conditions. After unpivoting product and packaging indicators to create a usable analysis structure, the dataset expanded to about 450,000 rows, because each product and package combination was separated into its own observation.

Prior to analysis, a series of data quality checks were conducted using Power Query Editor to ensure accuracy and reliability of insights. Key steps included:

· Handling missing values in product display fields and package types to ensure consistency.
· Checking for duplicate records.

Executive Summary

Coca-Cola, Pepsi and Fanta were the most widely available soft drink products across surveyed outlets in Alimosho, showing strong market presence and visibility. PET bottles were the most common packaging format used by nearly every major product, far ahead of cans and glass bottles. Stock levels were mixed, only a portion of products were well stocked, while many outlets recorded partially stocked, suggesting supply challenges. Shops and kiosks dominated distribution, and the highest outlet concentration appeared along major commercial routes like Akowonjo and Ijegun. In contrast, areas such as Ipaja-Ayobo showed fewer outlets, signaling possible expansion opportunities.

Insight Deep Dive

Coca-Cola led strongly in product availability, appearing in more outlets than any other brand. Pepsi followed closely behind, while other brands showed noticeably lower presence. PET bottles stood out as the most used packaging format across almost every product, suggesting both retailer preference and strong consumer demand for PET.

Stock levels revealed performance gaps. Although some top brands were consistently well stocked, many products showed large portions of partial stock or almost-empty status, which may mean restocking delays or fast turnover not matched by supply. Display analysis showed heavy reliance on shelf and carton displays inside stores, while refrigerator and cooler displays were used less often, limiting impulse cold-drink purchases.

Mapping outlet locations showed dense clusters around key commercial roads where customer traffic is high, meaning strong competition. Meanwhile, fewer outlets appeared across the Ipaja-Ayobo axis and parts of the southwest rural edge, showing room for market growth.
